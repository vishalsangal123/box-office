react doesn't have any builtin solution for the routing system  for this reason the react community has built a package that we can use a our routing system 

npm install react-router-dom react-router

TV Maze is an API it give an all information about actor and shows .
it is completely free for everyone
input element will have its "'internal'" state 
fetch function returns promises it means that we need to waited 
r.json means convert raw data in the form of json  (this r) mean response given by fetch function
second then receive result by the api(Application Programming Interface)

npm install styled-component

useeffect function runs only one time when the component is mounted if array is empty

if change in array value which is associated with useeffect function  then useeffect function call everytime 


clean up function: - It is the function that we return from the callback   This return function will be run that before the next callback will be fired 



  useEffect(()=>{

return ()=>{
   console.log('exit');
};

    console.log('xyz');
  },[searchOption]);
